# notes

Files of the form `n-medium-m.v` are notes taken during the `n`th week and `m`th
`medium`, e.g. `03-studio-05.v` contains notes from Studio Episode 5 released
during week 3. Some of these files contain redundant content since we go over
the same chapters multiple times. File `frap-n-chapter_name.v` is the `n`th Frap
chapter template with admitted exercise proofs filled in.
